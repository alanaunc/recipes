INGREDIENTS

SHAKE
1 large ripe banana (~200 g), previously peeled, sliced and frozen
2 Tbsp (32 g) salted natural peanut butter (if unsalted, add a pinch of salt)
1-2 dates, pitted (if not sticky and moist, soak in hot water for 10 minutes,
then drain)
1 Tbsp (5 g) cacao powder or unsweetened cocoa powder
1 to 1 1/2 cups (240 - 360 ml) Almond Breeze Almondmilk Original Unsweetened
Optional: 1/2 cup ice

ADD-INS
1 Tbsp cacao nibs for “chocolate chip” effect (blend in or use as topping)
1 Tbsp flax or hemp seeds for added nutrition
Dairy free chocolate sauce (for drizzling inside glass)
Coconut whipped cream for topping

INSTRUCTIONS
Add all ingredients except almond milk to the blender. Add in almond milk 1/2
cup at a time, adding only enough to allow the ingredients to blend together.
Add more for a thinner shake and less for a thicker shake.
Taste and adjust flavors, adding more banana or dates for sweetness, cacao for
chocolate flavor, and peanut butter for saltiness. Optional: Add a handful of
ice for extra thickness.
Serves 1 generously. Best when fresh, though leftovers will keep covered in the
fridge for up to 24 hours. You could even freeze this into popsicles!
